- [Alpaca API Key](https://alpaca.markets/)
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (The **best** Python package manager!)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account
- [flyctl CLI](https://fly.io/docs/)
- [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html) (Like a Makefile but better!)
